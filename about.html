    <h2>Hey Whatsup Hello</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m Kristi, ever since I can remember I’ve had the same dream. I want to travel and see the world. After college, I made that dream a reality. I went against the current that is American society and refused to move directly into corporate life. Instead, I booked a one way ticket to Ho Chi Minh city and backpacked SE Asia for 3 months.  After 3 months in Asia, I boarded a one way flight to Dubai. I had never been to the UAE, but I knew they had many opportunities for college educated Westerners.</p>

    <p>So there I wan in a new country that I didn’t know much about. On my arrival, I called my parents who were expecting me back in Dallas. They told me if I could find a job in two weeks time that I could stay for a year! I ended up staying in Dubai for over 4 years. I did make good on my promise, I had several job offerings in one week :)</p>

    <p>I spent 4.5 years in Dubai. I have to say it was the best gamble I ever made. I landed in Dubai with a backpack and left 4 years later with more luggage than I could check, friends that I consider family, a new respect for my independence and a new outlook on the life I want to lead.</p>

    <p>I have since moved to NYC where I still lead my life in the same manner. I work to fund my next adventure and always have a trip planned in the near future. To date I have travelled to over 35 countries. Some of my adventures have been on a shoe string budget (Traveling the coast of Western Australia in a VW van) while others have been full of luxury.</p>

    <p>So check out more of the blog for my travel tips, a deep dive into the middle east, destinations I’ve been to, packing tips and much more!</p>

    <p>xoxo
